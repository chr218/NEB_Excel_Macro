# NEB_Excel_Macro
This macro will automatically calculate the activation barrier, change the transition state energy to red, and create plots with curve fitting for each path. The user is responsible in generating a text format with directory paths between NEB energies. The text must be sequential and the final line must contain a "/". An example text format is provided. Along with a bash collection script (to generate such text format) and an example excel sheet. This is my first time learning visual basic, thus this code has many potential improvements.
